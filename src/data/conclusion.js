    "The heuristic evaluation of the Water Billing Management System revealed several usability challenges that, while not overly complex to fix, have a noticeable impact on how users interact with the system. These issues range from small interface concerns like hard-to-read system messages and confusing wording to more functional problems such as the inability to edit entries inline or access help documentation when needed.",
    "One of the most important takeaways is that users need to feel guided and in control. When a system provides clear feedback, allows for quick actions, and prevents errors through good design, users are much more likely to complete tasks efficiently and with confidence. Unfortunately, the current setup makes some common tasks feel more difficult than they need to be. Repetitive navigation, vague messages, and a lack of interactive elements slow down workflows and can frustrate users.",
    "Despite these issues, the system has a solid foundation. The core features work, and users are able to perform essential actions like adding clients, creating bills, and updating information. What’s needed now is refinement—making things more intuitive, visually clear, and aligned with user expectations. Simple improvements like clickable dashboard cards, real-time form validation, and accessible help resources can go a long way in creating a smoother experience.",
    "In short, while the system performs its intended functions, small design oversights currently get in the way of a truly user-friendly experience. By addressing the key usability problems outlined in this evaluation, the system can evolve into a more effective and satisfying tool for both administrators and clients. A few thoughtful changes can make a big difference—not only in how the system looks and feels, but in how confidently and efficiently people are able to use it."
